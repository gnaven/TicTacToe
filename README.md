Gazi Mahir Ahmed Naven

To run the program please run the Minimax.java class. This contains the mainmethod, and so you can compile the rest of 
the classes by compiling that. When it runs the program will prompt you to choose 1 or 2. if you choose 1
the simple 3X3 TTT will start. The computer will then ask you to choose if you wnat to be X or O. if you choose X you can 
go first. To make a move simply enter the slot number where you want to place your symbol. it starts from 0 and
goes till 8. 0 is the first box, 1 is the second one and so on the bottom-right is 8. 

If you play 2 which is the 9X9 board, computer will ask to enter X or O. X will go first. When you need to make a
move the computer will ask you, it will also provide you information on which board you will have to play, and
ask the position number similarly. If you are making the very first move, then you have the ability to choose whichever
board you want to make your move from 0-8. In that case you will be prompted in the begining to choose which board number

The console also shows the current state of the board, where X=1 and O=4 on the state.
